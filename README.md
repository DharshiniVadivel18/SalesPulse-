##  Problem Statement

Sales teams often collect large amounts of data but struggle to turn it into useful insights.

SalesPulse solves this by providing a structured, easy-to-use analytics tool.

##  OOP Concepts Used

- **Abstraction**: Each class handles a specific responsibility (data, logic, reporting, UI).
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public getters/methods ensure data integrity.
- **Inheritance**: Future report types can extend the base `ReportGenerator` class.
- **Polymorphism**: Interfaces can be used to generalize report generation behavior.
